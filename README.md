# Moofuslist 📍
#### An AI-powered application that provides a list of places to go and things to do for any city in the United States.
#### Loading of the cells is a little slow due to data coming from Apple Intelligence
#### Data contains hallucinations due to data coming from Apple Intelligence

### 🏛️ Project Purpose & Design Philosophy
#### This project was built to demonstrate my specific approach to how iOS software applications should be designed and implemented. It prioritizes a clean design to ensure the app is:
* Easy to understand.
* Easily maintainable.
* Highly scalable.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack
#### This application leverages the latest Apple frameworks to provide a modern, high-performance user experience.
| Feature | Technology | Implementation Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **UI Framework** | SwiftUI | Used for all UI elements to ensure a declarative and responsive interface. |
| **AI Integration** | Apple Intelligence | Leveraged to intelligently retrieve activities for the user. |
| **Concurrency** | Swift Concurrency | Implemented in place of Combine for modern, efficient asynchronous code. |
| **Persistence** | SwiftData | Utilized as the primary data storage solution for favorites. |
| **Communication** | AsyncStreams | Used for sending messages throughout the application. |
| **Location** | Core Location | Used for retrieving the user's current location. |
| **Mapping** | MapKit | MK methods are utilized for various geocoding requests. |
| **Testing Framework** | Swift Testing | Leveraged Swift Testing to detect logic failures, UI problems, and performance regressions. |

### 🏛️ Architectural Overview
#### The architecture of Moofuslist is built to demonstrate a modern, decoupled approach to iOS development. By moving away from legacy patterns, the project achieves a high degree of testability and scalability.
**✨ Key Features**
+ AI-Curated Discovery: Automatically gathers high-quality recommendations for any city in the U.S. using Apple Intelligence.
+ Modern Data Handling: Uses SwiftData and AsyncStreams for seamless data flow and storage.
+ Contextual Awareness: Integrates Core Location and MapKit to provide relevant, location-based information.
+ Architectural Excellence: Designed with a focus on code readability and long-term maintenance.
