# Moofuslist 📍
#### An AI-powered application that provides a list of places to go and things to do for any city in the United States.
#### Loading of the cells is a little slow due to getting data from Apple Intelligence

### 🏛️ Project Purpose & Design Philosophy
#### This project was built to demonstrate my specific approach to how iOS software applications should be designed and implemented. It prioritizes a clean design to ensure the app is:
* Easy to understand.
* Easily maintainable.
* Highly scalable.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack
#### This application leverages the latest Apple frameworks to provide a modern, high-performance user experience.
**Feature**:        **Technology**          **Implement Detail**
- UI Framework:     SwiftUI	            Used for all UI elements to ensure a declarative and responsive interface.
- AI Integration:   Apple Intelligence  Leveraged to intelligently retrieve activities for the user.
- Concurrency:      Swift Concurrency	  Implemented in place of Combine for modern, efficient asynchronous code.
- Persistence:      SwiftData	          Utilized as the primary data storage solution.
- Communication:    AsyncStreams	      Used for sending messages throughout the application.
- Location:         Core Location	      Used for retrieving the user's current location.
- Mapping:          MapKit	            MK methods are utilized for various geocoding requests.

### 🏛️ Architectural Overview
#### The architecture of Moofuslist is built to demonstrate a modern, decoupled approach to iOS development. By moving away from legacy patterns, the project achieves a high degree of testability and scalability.
**✨ Key Features**
